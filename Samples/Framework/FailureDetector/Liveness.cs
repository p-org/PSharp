    /// to express liveness specifications such as absence of deadlocks
    /// and livelocks in the test program, using a liveness monitor.
    ///
    /// This monitor starts in the state 'Init' and transitions to the
    /// state 'Wait' upon receiving the event 'RegisterNodes', which
    /// contains references to all nodes in the program.
    ///
    /// Whenever the 'Driver' machine receives a 'NodeFailed' event from
    /// the 'FailureDetector' machine, it forwards that event to the
    /// this monitor which then removes the machine whose failure was
    /// detected from the set of nodes.
    ///
    /// The monitor exits the 'Hot' 'Init' state only when all nodes becomes
    /// empty, i.e., when the failure of all node machines has been detected.
    /// Thus, this monitor expresses the specification that failure of
    /// every node machine must be eventually detected.
