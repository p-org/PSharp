Samples
========
This is a collection of P# samples that are written using the _optional_ high-level syntax of P#.

## How to build

To test each produced executable use the following command:
```
PSharpTester.exe /test:Sample.exe /i:100
```
Where `Sample.exe` is the corresponding executable.

With the above command, the P# tester will systematically test the sample for 100 testing iterations.
