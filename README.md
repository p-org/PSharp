P#
====================
An **actor-based** programming language for developing **highly-reliable asynchronous software**, such as web-services and distributed systems.

## Features
- Enables the development of efficient asynchronous applications using an **event-driven**, actor-based programming model. Because **all the asynchrony is explicitly exposed** at specific communication points in a P# program, the user does not need to explicitly create and manage tasks; the P# runtime is instead responsible for handling all the underlying concurrency, allowing the developer to focus on application logic.
- Allows the environment to be **modeled** via language constructs. The compiler can then automatically substitute real code with modeled, and **systematically test** the compiled executable to discover bugs (such as assertion failures and uncaught exceptions).
- Provides strong **data race freedom** guarantees. The compiler is able to perform a **scalable static data race analysis** on the source code that can detect all potential data races in a program (based on certain assumptions, such as no use of non-P# threading or reflection).
- Fully interoperates with C#: the developer can **write any C# code** inside a P# program. P# is basically an extension of C#, build on top of the Roslyn and .NET frameworks, which not only makes P# easy to learn comparing with a completely new language, but also allows **easy integration with existing code**.

## Build instructions
1. Get Visual Studio 2015 Preview (required for Microsoft Roslyn).
2. Clone this project and compile using VS2015.

Optional: Get the [Visual Studio 2015 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46850) to be able to compile the P# visual studio extension (syntax highlighting).

## How to use
A good way to start is by reading the [manual](https://cdn.rawgit.com/p-org/PSharp/master/Docs/Manual/out/manual.pdf).

The P# compiler can be used to parse a program, statically analyse it for data races and finally compile it to an executable. To invoke the compiler use the following command:

```
.\PSharpCompiler.exe /s:${SOLUTION_PATH}\${SOLUTION_NAME}.sln
```

Where ${SOLUTION\_PATH} is the path to your P# solution and ${SOLUTION\_NAME} is the name of your P# solution.

To specify an output path destination use the option `/o:${OUTPUT\_PATH}`.

To compile only a specific project in the solution use the option `/p:${PROJECT_NAME}`.

## Options

To see various available command line options use the option `/?`.

To statically analyze the program for data races use the option `/analyze`.

To systematically test the program for bugs (i.e. assertion failures and exceptions) use the option `/test`. You can optionally give the number of testing iterations to perform using `/i:value`.
