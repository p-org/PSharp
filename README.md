P#
===
A framework for **building**, **analyzing**, **systematically testing** and **debugging** asynchronous reactive software. P# is used by engineers in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to design, implement and thoroughly test distributed systems and services.

## Features
The P# framework provides:
- Language extensions to C# for building **event-driven asynchronous** applications, writing **test harnesses**, and specifying **safety** and **liveness properties**.
- A **systematic testing engine** that can capture and control all specified nondeterminism in the system, systematically explore the actual executable code to discover bugs, and report bug traces. A P# bug trace provides a global order of all communication events, and thus is easier to debug.
- Support for **replaying** bug traces, and **debugging** them using the Visual Studio debugger.

## Getting started
Read the P# programming guide and then read about various features and topics [here](Docs/README.md).

## How to build
Follow the [instructions](Docs/BuildInstructions.md) to build P# from source, or just install our latest P# [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PSharp/).

## How to contribute
